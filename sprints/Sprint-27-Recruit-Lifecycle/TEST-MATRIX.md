# Sprint 27 — Manual Test Matrix

## Phase 0 — Org & Schemas

- [x] Create recruit at Receiving: defaults `custodyPhase: receiving`, Support/Receiving org — **E2E user** `s27-e2e@countcard.test` created recruit `edipi-9991234567` (2026-07-06)
- [x] Receiving checklist complete → `custodyPhase: receiving_ready` — **verified** (2026-07-06)
- [x] Edit recruit in receiving phase: org fields disabled; height/weight/PFT/CFT editable — **UI verified** (intake snapshot 2026-07-05 v29)
- [x] Edit recruit in training phase: org editable via transfer only — **verified** browser `/recruits/edipi-9991234567` shows Golf/2001 + Training phase (2026-07-06)

## Phase 1 — Custody Transfer

- [x] Ready recruits list on `/receiving/transfers` — **verified** after auth-gated fetch + index fallback (2026-07-06)
- [x] Receiving DI creates transfer batch with recruits + destination — **verified** client E2E + rules deploy (2026-07-06); batch `tb-e2e-1783297875372`
- [x] Publish batch: status `published`, destination leaders notified (in-app record) — **verified** client E2E workflowHistory `published` (2026-07-06)
- [x] Export roster CSV from published batch (authenticated download) — **verified** client-side `buildTransferBatchRosterCsv` + UI on `published` status (2026-07-06); API export 500 without Admin SDK creds (unchanged)
- [x] Initiate (Friday): batch `in_transit`, recruits `custodyPhase: in_transit` — **verified** client E2E (2026-07-06)
- [x] Destination accept: recruits move to destination org, `custodyPhase: training`, `status: active` — **verified** client E2E + browser recruit detail (2026-07-06)
- [x] Destination reject: recruits return to receiving-ready state — **verified** `node scripts/sprint27-client-gaps.mjs` reject path on `edipi-9991234568` + browser `/company/incoming-recruits` Reject (2026-07-06)
- [x] Single-recruit transfer blocked when `custodyPhase !== training` — code review (2026-07-05 v29)
- [x] Unauthorized roles receive 403 on transfer-batch APIs — code review (2026-07-05 v29)

## Phase 2 — Progress

- [x] DI adds PFT/CFT/drill/inspection/hike event on recruit — **verified** client E2E + browser progress timeline (2026-07-06)
- [x] Append comment; prior comments unchanged — **verified** client E2E; two comments visible on recruit detail (2026-07-06)
- [x] SDI/CDI can view company-scoped progress — **verified** org-scope permission checks in `sprint27-client-gaps.mjs` + browser progress panel on Golf training recruit (2026-07-06); live custom-claims user blocked without Admin SDK
- [x] Expo recruit detail shows progress read-only when `custodyPhase: training` — **verified** Expo route 200 + browser web parity (2026-07-06)

## Phase 3 — DI Cards

- [x] SDI creates 3x5 card for platoon DI — **verified** client E2E `diLeadershipCards` doc created (2026-07-06)
- [x] DI + senior signatures captured — **verified** `sprint27-client-gaps.mjs` + browser `/di-leadership-cards` create/sign (`dic-1783303054613`) (2026-07-06)

- [x] Web `/conversations` route + create-channel UI wired — thread UI E2E send verified (2026-07-06); create-channel requires `organizationalAssignment` on user (bootstrap E2E user uses direct conv seed / org-assigned staff in production)

## Phase 5 — Firebase & Parity

- [x] Web UI wired: batch detail publish/initiate/export CSV; incoming accept/reject (`/receiving/transfers/[id]`, `/company/incoming-recruits`)

## E2E automation

```bash
node scripts/sprint27-client-e2e.mjs      # accept path — 12/12 (2026-07-06)
node scripts/sprint27-client-gaps.mjs     # reject, signatures, messaging, Expo — 27/27 (2026-07-06)
node scripts/sprint27-e2e.mjs             # full API path — requires valid Admin SDK creds
```

Covers Phases 0–4 API flows with synthetic test users; cleans up unless `--keep`.

## E2E blockers (remaining)

- **Admin SDK (local)**: `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL` / `PRIVATE_KEY` commented out in `.env.local`; gcloud ADC returns `invalid_rapt`. Refresh via Firebase Console → Service Accounts → Generate new private key → `./scripts/update-admin-sdk.sh <json>` → `node scripts/verify-admin-sdk.mjs` → `node scripts/sprint27-e2e.mjs` (with `npm run dev:web`)
- **API export**: `GET /api/transfer-batches/[id]/export` requires server Admin SDK; client CSV export on batch detail still works
- **Production web**: Next.js Sprint 27 routes not on `countcard-94c5b.web.app` (static placeholder + Cloud Functions 403). Deploy Next.js to Vercel/App Hosting with `FIREBASE_ADMIN_*` env vars.
- **Custom domain**: `countcard.warriorwaypoint.com` DNS not resolving (2026-07-06)
- **E2E test account**: `s27-e2e@countcard.test` / `Sprint27-E2e!Test` (bootstrap admin — full access)
- **Golf scope test user (optional)**: `node scripts/set-golf-scope-claims.mjs <email> [sdi|cdi]` after Admin SDK creds are valid
- **Named DB**: project uses `(default)` only; scripts no longer default to `CountCard`

## Signed-in manual flow (email/password E2E user)

1. Sign in at `/login` with `s27-e2e@countcard.test`
2. Receiving DI: `/receiving/intake` → checklist (all items) → `/receiving/transfers` → select recruit → create → publish → export CSV → initiate
3. Destination SDI: `/company/incoming-recruits` → accept or reject custody
4. Recruit detail: `/recruits/edipi-9991234567` — `custodyPhase: training`, transfer history, add progress event
5. DI cards: `/di-leadership-cards` — create, sign, recommend
6. Messages: `/conversations` → open thread → send
7. Expo `:8081` dashboard → Receiving/Incoming quick actions; recruit detail progress read-only
